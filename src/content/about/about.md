I'm a full-stack engineer and sophomore uni student. I design, build, and ship scalable infrastructure for the modern web. My core stack is TypeScript, Go, and React.

I started working professionally at 16, building Minecraft mods for fun. At 17, I landed my first React dev job and got hooked. Most of my early serious work was in web3. Since then I've grown up to be 20 (unc) and I've diluted back into web2 quite a lot.

Currently, I'm a developer at [soldecoder.app](https://soldecoder.app), working on fintech solutions including Meteora liquidity management automation that's generated hundreds of thousands of dollars in profit for our users, and trading automation tools for perpetual DEXes with similar impact. I also co-founded [ganthiyalabs.xyz](https://ganthiyalabs.xyz) with my friends, where we build dev tools and consumer apps.

I was into fintech for a while, but now I'm pivoting towards dev tools, cloud infra, and a lot of backend engineering.

Outside of tech, I'm deeply invested in:

- **Weapons & Aviation**
- **Linguistics** — ~~Russian~~, ~~Mongolian~~, ~~French~~, Arabic, Farsi, Italian, Kyrgyz, and a bit of Mandarin
- **Biking & Machines**
- **Music** -- learning to play the flute.
